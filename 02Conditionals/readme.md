# Conditionals in C

This section covers **conditional statements** in C programming.  
Conditionals allow your program to make decisions and execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered
- `if` statement  
- `if...else` statement  
- `nested if` statement  
- `else if` ladder  
- `switch` statement  
- Conditional (ternary) operator `?:`

## ðŸ’» Example Programs
1. Check whether a number is even or odd

4. Grade calculation using `if...else if`  
5. Simple calculator using `switch` statement  
6. Check leap year using conditional operator
